    <p class="a">Digital Pinboards is a software I created to identify work and system status configuration on mechanical/electrical/engineering diagrams. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br>
        /newdiagram allows the user to implement a new system into the database. Allows the ability to upload an image file of the diagram and the file name will be the system name. When submitted, the system will be uploaded to the database. Afterwards, the user can add valves/components of the system to the diagram map. The system will automatically implement the new component into the component database.
        <br>
        <br>
        /systemlist allows usage and control of diagram valves and components. When the page is loaded, the user will have access to load all systems in the database. When a system is selected and loaded, the system diagram is displayed and all of the system component information and status are loaded for display. The user may manipulate status of the work being performed in the area easily by clicking on the image map.
        <br>
        <br>
        /systemlookup allows user to search for components through the database, excluding the need for the visual display of the system. This allows the user to search for a component that may be listed on multiple system diagrams.
        <br>
        <br>
        /systemhistorydata logs all system configuration changes, allowing a complete history of the lifetime of maintainence and work performed on a system or structure.
        <br>
        <br>
        The program is hosted on Microsoft Azure, allowing 24/7 access through the cloud. Github is used for continuous integration and continuous development of the system to accurately control database changes while maintaining proper integrity of the program.
